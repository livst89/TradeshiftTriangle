# Assignment notes

## 1.0 Problem to solve

Determine triangle type by side lengths.

### 1.1: Valid triangle?

Does the three lengths allow for a triangle?

Requirements: Not 0 or less, and two shorter sides added together must be
greater than the longest side.

### 1.2: Triangle types

Types to check for: Equilateral, isosceles or scalene.

Equilateral: All sides are same length.

Isosceles: Two sides are same length.

Scalene: No congruent side lengths.


Possible bonus: Check for right, acute and obtuse triangle? Converse Pythagorean
Theorem.

"If the square of the length of the longest side of a triangle is equal to the
sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides, then the triangle is
a right triangle."

c^2 < a^2 + b^2 = acute

c^2 = a^2 + b^2 = right

c^2 > a^2 + b^2 = obtuse



## 2.0 Thoughts on project structure

KISS: Keep It Simple Stupid. Single page application, one JS file for triangle
calculations.

HTML: Semantic elements.

JS file: Separation of functionality with clearly named functions.
